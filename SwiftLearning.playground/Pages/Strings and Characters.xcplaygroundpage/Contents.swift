 # Strings & Characters
 * callout(Session Overview): Strings are one of Swift's fundamental data types that stores a series of characters such as "Hello Student". In this session we will go into more detail about `String`'s capabilities and learn what properties and functions that are available. Please refer to the Swift Language Guide section [Strings and Characters](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID285) and also the [String](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_String_Structure/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/struct/s:SS) data type in the Swift Standard Library Reference to read even more about Swift's Strings.

import Foundation
/*:
## Initializing
There are two way to create a `String`. You can create a `String` by using a string literal such as "Hello Again", or by appending parenthese at the end of String such as `String()`
*/
let stringEmptyLiteral = ""
var stringEmptyInstance = String()
//: Both statements above create strings that initialized the storage to an empty string.
let stringLiteral = "I'm a literal"
var stringInstance = String("I'm an instance")
//: Both statements above create strings that initialized the storage to actual string value.
let stringInterpolation = "\(stringLiteral) and \(stringInstance)"
//: The above statement creates a string that initialized the storage using string interpolation.
/*:
## When you're allowed to change or *mutate* a `String`
In some cases, you need to keep the contents of the `String` unchanged throughout the entire program. Also, there are cases where you would like to change the contents of the `String`, such as appending additional text. You indicate this by selecting the correct keyword of either `let` (constant) or `var` (variable).
*/
let stringCannotBeChanged = "I can't be changed."
//stringCannotBeChanged += " I want to add more" // -> uncomment to see what the compile error is

var stringCanBeChanged = String("I can be changed.")
stringCanBeChanged += " I want to add more"
//: > When we use the word *instance*, think of it as owning a copy (`String` in this context) of a data type, but your copy could be different because of the way you initialized it or mutated it. When working with `String`s, we create instances of the `String` data type and available to us are properties (attributes) and methods (behavior).
let abeQuote  = "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."
var abeQuote2 = "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
let abeQuote3 = "Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."
/*:
## Instance Properties
All Strings have attributes called properties that provide you the ability to retrieve information about an instance of a String.
*/
//: **About String Indices** Strings in swift have a property of the `Index` data type that enable you to execute statements on `Character`s of the `String`. The `Index` data type provides methods (more on methods in [Functions](Functions) and - [Classes & Structures](Classes%20and%20Structures)) such as `successor()` and `predecessor()`.
/*:
**Experiment**: Take a moment to learn about the methods on the `Index` data type.

*/
let startPlus1 = abeQuote.startIndex.successor()                    // get the next `Index` starting with the startIndex
let endMinus1 = abeQuote.endIndex.predecessor()                     // get the previous `Index` starting with the endIndex
let startPlus10 = abeQuote.startIndex.advancedBy(10)                // get an `Index` advancing by 10 indexes
let endMinus10 = abeQuote.endIndex.advancedBy(-10)                  // get an `Index` advancing by -10 indexes
let distance = abeQuote.startIndex.distanceTo(abeQuote.endIndex)    // get an `Index` moving the distance to another `Index`

// the count of characters in a string should be equal to the distance from start to end
abeQuote.characters.count == abeQuote.startIndex.distanceTo(abeQuote.endIndex)
//: Use `startIndex` to get the index of the starting position of a String.
print("The start index is \(abeQuote.startIndex)")
//: Use `endIndex` to get the index of the ending position of a String.
print("The endIndex index is \(abeQuote.endIndex)")
//: Use `isEmpty` to determine if a String has a value.
print("The string is empty? = \(abeQuote.isEmpty)")

let anotherQuote = ""

print("The string is empty? = \(anotherQuote.isEmpty)")
//: Use `lowercaseString` to convert all characters in the String to lowercase.
print(abeQuote.lowercaseString)
//: Use `uppercaseString` to convert all characters in the String to uppercase.
print(abeQuote.uppercaseString)
//: The `characters` property provides access to the list of characters in a String. Use the `characters.count` to get the count of number of characters in a String.
print("Quote has \(abeQuote.characters.count) characters")
/*:

## Instance Methods
All Strings have methods that allow you to interact with a String, such as adding to, removing from, replacing within, checking for the existence of other characters of Strings, and finding substrings from based on indexes or ranges.
*/
/*:
### Adding to a String
You can create a new String by concatenating multiple strings together or change the contents within a String by using either append or insert.
*/
//: Use `+` the plus symbol to add or concat multiple string together
let quoteFirstHalf = "Give me six hours to chop down a tree"
let quoteSecondHalf = "and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe"

let quoteFull = quoteFirstHalf + " " + quoteSecondHalf
print(quoteFull)

var quoteFull2 = quoteFirstHalf
quoteFull2 += " " + quoteSecondHalf // also allowd to use the compound assignment add operator
print(quoteFull2)

print(quoteFull == quoteFull2)
//: Use `append` to add a character to the end of a string.
var give = "G"
var charI: Character = "i"
var charV: Character = "v"
var charE: Character = "e"
give.append(charI)
give.append(charV)
give.append(charE)

print(give)
//: Use `insert` to add a character at the specified index.
give.insert("!", atIndex: give.endIndex)

print(give)
//: Use `insertContentsOf` to add the characters of a String at the specified index.
give.insertContentsOf(" me six hours".characters, at: give.startIndex.advancedBy(5))

print(give)
/*:
### Removing from a String
You can also remove characters or a range of characters within a String.
*/
//: Use `removeAll` to remove all characters from a String
abeQuote2.removeAll();

print(abeQuote2)

abeQuote2 += "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
//: Use `removeAtIndex` to remove a character at the specified index.
abeQuote2.removeAtIndex(abeQuote2.endIndex.predecessor())

print(abeQuote2)
//: Use `removeRange` to remove characters using the specified range.
let range = abeQuote2.endIndex.advancedBy(-6)..<abeQuote2.endIndex

abeQuote2.removeRange(range)

print(abeQuote2)
/*:
### Replacing content in a String
You can replace a portion of a String with another Character or String.
*/
let range2 = abeQuote2.endIndex.advancedBy(-39)..<abeQuote2.endIndex.advancedBy(-38)

abeQuote2.replaceRange(range2, with: "A")

print(abeQuote2)
/*:
### Checking for values
You can check if a String starts with (prefix) or ends with (Suffix) a String.
*/
let startsWith = abeQuote2.hasPrefix("Better");

print(startsWith)

let endsWith = abeQuote2.hasSuffix("doubt!")

print(endsWith)
/*:
### Finding Substrings
You can find Strings contained in other Strings, also known as substrings.
*/
//: Use `substringFromIndex` to get a substring starting with an index
let giveHimPower = abeQuote3.substringFromIndex(abeQuote3.endIndex.advancedBy(-15))

print(giveHimPower)
//: Use `substringToIndex` to get a substring up to the index
let adversity = abeQuote3.substringToIndex(abeQuote3.startIndex.advancedBy(34))

print(adversity)
//: Use `substringWithRange` to get a substring based off of a range
let test = abeQuote3.substringWithRange(abeQuote3.startIndex.advancedBy(55)..<abeQuote3.endIndex.advancedBy(-17))

print(test)

 * callout(Exercise): Get Acquainted. Get a few properties of each student in your class... name and email are good. Use the `String` and `Character` as well as the data types and operators in [Basics | Data Types | Operators](Basics%20|%20Data%20Types%20|%20Operators) to complete this exercise.
 
 **Example Output:**
 - `My name is Mathew Sheets, my email is swift.dude@gmail.com.`
 - `Other students in my class are Annie, Sam, Jack, Hudson and Oliver.`
 - `Oliver dropped this class.` (**use the second bullet point string to pull out the last students's name.**)
 - `Other students in my class are Annie, Sam, Jack, Hudson and CARSON was added.`  (**use the second bullet point string and append another student.**)
 - `Jack and Hudson are in the class.` (**use the second bullet point string to pull out third and fourth student.**)
 
 **Constraints:**
 - Use a nested tuple to hold your students
 - Use the string created from the second bullet point for all other string creation
 * callout(Checkpoint): At this point, you should be able to create, mutate, and execute statements on `String`s and `Character`s data types. You also should understand how to work with the `Index` data type of a `String`.
 * callout(Supporting Materials): Chapters and sections from the Guide and Vidoes from WWDC
